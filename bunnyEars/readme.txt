Bunny Ears

We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ...The odd bunnies (1, 3, ...) have the normal 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ...) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot.
Recursively return the number of "ears" tn the bunny line 1, 2, ... n.

bunnyEars(0) -> 0
bunnyEars(1) -> 2
bunnyEars(2) -> 5
