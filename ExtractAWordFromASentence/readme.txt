Extract a Word From a Sentence
Implement a method removeWord() that takes two string parameters:

sentence - the sentence you are to remove a word from.
word - the word you are to remove from the sentence.
Your method should take a string, sentence and remove word from it.
It will return a new string without word in the sentence.

Examples:
removeWord("One two three four", "two") ➞ "One three four"

removeWord("Bob has a kid", "kid") ➞ "Bob has a"
