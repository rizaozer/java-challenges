Number of Boomerangs
A boomerang is a V-shaped sequence that is either upright or upside down.
Specifically, a boomerang can be defined as: sub-array of length 3, with the first and last digits
being the same and the middle digit being different.

Some boomerang examples:

[3, 7, 3], [1, -1, 1], [5, 6, 5]
Create a function that returns the total number of boomerangs in an array.

To illustrate:

[3, 7, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, -2, 2]
// 3 boomerangs in this sequence:  [3, 7, 3], [1, 5, 1], [2, -2, 2]
