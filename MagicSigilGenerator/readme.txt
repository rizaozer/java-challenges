Magic Sigil Generator
A magic sigil is a glyph which represents a desire one wishes to manifest in their lives.
There are many ways to create a sigil, but the most common is to write out a specific desire
(e.g. "I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS WHO LOVE ME"), remove all vowels, remove any duplicate letters
 (keeping the last occurence), and then design a glyph from what remains.

Using the sentence above as an example, we would remove duplicate letters:
AUFRINDSWHLOVME

And then remove all vowels, leaving us with:
FRNDSWHLVM

Create a function that takes a string and removes its vowels and duplicate letters.
The returned string should not contain any spaces and be in uppercase.

Examples:
sigilize("i am healthy") ➞ "MLTHY"

sigilize("I FOUND MY SOULMATE") ➞ "FNDYSLMT"

sigilize("I have a job I enjoy and it pays well") ➞ "HVBJNDTPYSWL"
Notes
For duplicate letters the last one is kept.
When performing actual sigil magic, you must make your sigils manually.
